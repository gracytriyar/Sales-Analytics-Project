# Sales Analytics Dashboard

## 🏢 Business Problem / Context
A retail company wants to improve revenue, optimize product performance, and enhance customer retention.  
They have detailed sales transaction data with customers, products, dates, regions, and shipping info.  
However, they don’t know:  
- Which products are profitable or underperforming  
- Who their top customers are  
- How geography impacts sales  
- How shipping affects delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction  
- How sales trends evolve over time  

Your task is to provide actionable insights that can help the business make strategic decisions.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **end-to-end Sales Analytics** using Python, MySQL, and Power BI.  
The goal is to analyze sales data to uncover **revenue trends, customer behavior, product performance, and regional insights**, and to present findings through interactive dashboards.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** → Imported data into MySQL, performed profiling and basic cleaning  
- **MySQL** → Data querying and preparation for analysis  
- **Power BI** → Created interactive dashboards with dynamic slicers and three main views (Overall, Geography, Product)  

⚙️ Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
	•	Power BI Desktop → Main data visualization platform used for creating the report.
	•	Power Query → Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing raw data.
	•	DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) → Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
	•	Data Modeling → Relationships established among tables (e.g., sales, customers, products) to enable cross-functional insights.
	•	Bookmarks → Implemented to enable dynamic navigation and visibility (e.g., switching between different dashboard views such as Product Analysis or Geographical Analysis).
	•	File Formats → .pbix (development file) and .png (dashboard preview images).
